          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Punjabi chole masala or chana masala is one of the most popular
            curry dishes from India. In fact in north India no wedding or party
            is complete until you have chole masala on the menu. I remember
            whenever we would call someone over for lunch or dinner, mom would
            almost always make chole. So what actually is chole masala? In this
            recipe, chickpeas are cooked with onions, tomatoes and lots of
            spices. A special blend of spices called “chole powder/masala” is
            easily available at every Indian store. One can make chole masala
            powder at home too by dry roasting ingredients like cumin, cloves,
            coriander, peppercorn, cardamom etc. But I usually get the masala
            from the store, saves me time and also tastes good.

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>
              In a pressure cooker add the soaked and drained chickpeas, around
              5 cups water, 2 tea bags, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon stick and
              some salt. Pressure cook at high flame till you get 1-2 whistles.
              After that lower the flame to medium and let the chickpeas cook
              for another 10-12 minutes. Remove the cooker from heat and allow
              it to cool down. Once the steam is gone, open the cooker and check
              the chickpeas. You should be able to press them easily with your
              fingers. If not, close the cooker and cook for 2 more whistles.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a wok, heat 2 tsp of oil. Once hot, add cloves and grated
              onions. Fry the onions till the raw smell goes away and they are
              light golden brown in color.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for 3-4 minutes till the smell of
              ginger-garlic goes away.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now add the tomato puree , stir and let it cook for 12-15 minutes
              on medium-low flame. Cover the pan to prevent splash all around.
              This step in my opinion is very important. The tomatoes need to be
              cooked really well till the raw smell goes away completely. So
              have patience and let them cook for around 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the chole masala, red chilli powder, paprika powder, cumin
              powder, salt and mix for a 1-2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drain the the chickpeas and add them to the tomato-onion mixture,
              stir till all the chickpeas are coated with spices, around 2
              minutes. Do not throw away the water once you have drained the
              chickpeas. We will add the same water in the gravy
