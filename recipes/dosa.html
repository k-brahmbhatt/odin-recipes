          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            A properly made crisp and savory Indian dosa is wonderfully
            delicious, and fairly simple to make at home, with this caveat: the
            batter must be fermented overnight for the correct texture and
            requisite sour flavor. However, once the batter is ready, it can be
            refrigerated and kept for several days, even a week. With a
            traditional spicy potato filling, dosas makes a perfect vegetarian
            breakfast or lunch. Serve them with your favorite chutney.

          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>2 cups short-grain rice</li>
            <li>½ cup urad dal (split husked black lentils)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="content-item">
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>
              Make the dosa batter: Put rice in a bowl, rinse well and cover
              with 4 cups cold water. Put urad dal and fenugreek seeds in a
              small bowl, rinse well and add cold water to cover. Leave both to
              soak for 4 to 6 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drain rice and dal-fenugreek mixture in separate colanders. Put
              rice in a food processor, blender or wet-dry grinder. Add 1 cup
              cold water and grind to a smooth paste. It will take about 10
              minutes, and it may be necessary to work in batches. Repeat the
              process with the dal-fenugreek mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine the two pastes in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk together,
              adding enough water to obtain a medium-thick batter. You should
              have about 6 cups. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and set in a
              warm place. Let ferment until the surface is bubbly, about 8
              hours. Stir in the salt. Use the batter straight away or
              refrigerate for later use. (Batter will keep for up to a week,
              refrigerated. Thin with water if necessary before proceeding.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Make the potato filling: Put ghee in a wide skillet over medium
              heat. When oil is wavy, add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Wait
              for seeds to pop, about 1 minute, then add red peppers and onion.
              Cook, stirring until onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Season
              lightly with salt. Add turmeric, asafetida, ginger, curry leaves,
              garlic and green chile. Stir to coat and let sizzle for 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add potatoes and ½ cup water. Cook, stirring well to combine,
              until liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Mash potatoes a bit
              with the back of a wooden spoon. Season well with salt, add
              cilantro, then set aside at room temperature. (Potato filling may
              be prepared up to a day in advance.)
            </li>
            <li>
              To make dosas, set a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium
              heat. Brush with about 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Ladle ¼ cup
              batter in the center of griddle. Using bottom of ladle, quickly
              spread batter outward in a circular motion to a diameter of about
              7 inches. Drizzle ½ teaspoon oil over the top.
